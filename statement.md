# 📄 Project Statement — Car Rental Management System (Console-Based)

## 🔹 Problem Statement
Small car rental businesses often struggle with maintaining a record of available cars and rental status using manual paperwork.  
There is a need for a lightweight and user-friendly system that can quickly display available cars and update rental status without requiring technical expertise or complex hardware.

This project aims to provide a **simple Java-based console application** that allows operators to view cars and process rentals efficiently.
